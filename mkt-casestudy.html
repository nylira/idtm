          <p class="intro">The reason why we exist is to help companies like <strong><a href="http://pipedrive.com">Pipedrive</a></strong> work richly.  They have an amazing story &#8212; they&#8217;ve gone from Timo selling books door-to-door in San Jose to a company that spans three continents and has created one of the hottest and most useful CRM tools on the market today.  We&#8217;re so proud to be an <strong>ingredient in their success</strong>.</p>

          <p>I love the guys at Pipedrive because their <strong>ambition is global</strong>.  They know that sales is a problem that knows no boundaries&#8212;not language nor culture&#8212;and so from day one, their scope has been international.  Pipedrive was founded in Estonia, but at any given time, its founders are in Tallinn, San Francisco, Santiago, or Nairobi to spread the good word about Pipedrive, a <a href="http://pipedrive.com">simple CRM</a> that people actually use.</p>

          <p>With distributed teams, there&#8217;s a <strong>daily struggle for team members to maintain a basic understanding of each other</strong>, especially across different disciplines.  <strong>We get stuck in our silos</strong>.  At Pipedrive, marketing has its own Skype chat and its own weekly standups.  Engineering has its nose in Asana and it&#8217;s filled with technical mumbo jumbo that no one else in the company can understand.  </p>

          <p>iDoneThis bridges this divide.  Just taking 30 seconds to write down the three highlights from the day pays huge dividends in giving the team a basic understanding of teammates&#8217; contributions and the direction and progress of the company.  They dig up the company roadmap on a quarterly basis at Pipedrive and have a &#8220;all-hands&#8221; meeting.  <strong>iDoneThis keeps the company together and headed in the right direction</strong> in the meantime.</p>

          <p>Maybe this is best experienced from the perspective of the &#8220;new guy.&#8221;  Pipedrive recently had a new developer start working for them remotely, and he was immediately bombarded by questions on Skype <strong>asking him what he got done by four different people every day</strong>.  On Skype, it&#8217;s hard to tell what someone is feeling, and the most benign questions can become irritating and overbearing.  The new developer was thrilled to use iDoneThis, because now no one pesters him to find out what he&#8217;s done, everyone just knows.  </p>

          <p>Pipedrive exemplifies how a company can use international reach to drive revenue growth.  To make that happen, <strong>they&#8217;ve mastered the art of working together remotely</strong>. We&#8217;re proud to be a part of their workflow, one that encourages understanding and appreciating the work of other business divisions and one that fosters daily participation in and ownership over the trajectory of the company as a whole.</p>
